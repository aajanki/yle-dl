  (enabled in yle-dl by default). Long streams can now be downloaded
  in a single session.
- Replace characters in filenames that are illegal on certain
  filesystems.

  option given and the file exists.

  since 1.1).

24 Jul 2009, version 1.1.1

- Re-enable faster than real-time downloads by correctly setting
  the buffer size before connecting.

  yle-dl.
- It is now possible to download videos that require YLE passi by
  giving the Areena cookie with the --auth command line option.
- Append the optional parameters to the play packet only when their
  values differ from default. The server seems be less likely to drop
  connections this way.

- Fixed a memory corruption in MP3 URL parsing code caused by
  allocating too few bytes.

- Avoid the temporary file by create the final destination file after
  receiving stream title but before starting downloading.
- Don't overwrite files: append an integer to file name, if the file
  already exists.
- When extracting clip ID, download the page if necessary. Now also
  program name URLs can be used in addition to clip ID URLs.
