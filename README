yle-dl is a rtmpdump frontend for downloading media files from the
video streaming services of the Finnish national broadcasting company
Yle: Yle Areena (http://areena.yle.fi, http://ylex.yle.fi/ylex-areena)
and Elävä Arkisto (http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/).

Installation
------------

Install prerequisites: rtmpdump, python and pycrypto.

On Debian/Ubuntu installing packages rtmpdump, python and
python-pycrypto satisfies the dependencies.

To install run:

make install

Starting from version 1.99.9 yle-dl doesn't anymore require a modified
rtmpdump or plugin. Instead, everything is now downloadable with the
plain rtmpdump. To remove the remnants of previous versions run "make
uninstall-old-rtmpdump".

Usage
-----

yle-dl [yle-dl or rtmpdump options] URL

where URL is the address of the Areena or Elävä arkisto web page where
you would normally watch the video in a browser.

yle-dl options:

--latestepisode   Download the latest episodes
--showurl         Print librtmp-compatible URL, don't download
--vfat            Create Windows-compatible filenames
--sublang lang    Download subtitles, lang = fin, swe, smi, none or all
--rtmpdump path   Set path to rtmpdump binary
--destdir dir     Save files to dir

Type "rtmpdump --help" to see a full list of options.

When downloading from outside Finland, it may be necessary to add "-n
flashu.yle.fi" on the command line. Note that not all videos are
available outside Finland.

Firewall must allow outgoing traffic on ports 80 and 1935.
