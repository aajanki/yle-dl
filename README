yle-dl is a rtmpdump frontend for downloading media files from the
video streaming services of the Finnish national broadcasting company
Yle: Yle Areena (http://areena.yle.fi, http://ylex.yle.fi/ylex-areena)
and El채v채 Arkisto (http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/).

Installation
------------

Install dependencies: rtmpdump (version 2.4 or newer), python and
pycrypto.

On Debian/Ubuntu installing packages rtmpdump, python and
python-pycrypto satisfies the dependencies.

On OS X install rtmpdump with homebrew: ``brew install --HEAD
rtmpdump`` and pycrypto with pip: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

To install run:

make install

Starting from version 1.99.9 yle-dl doesn't anymore require a modified
rtmpdump or plugin. Instead, everything is now downloadable with the
plain rtmpdump. To remove the remnants of previous versions run "make
uninstall-old-rtmpdump".

RPM package:

contrib/yle-dl.spec is a spec file for creating RPM-package for Fedora.

Usage
-----
