- Send swfUrl when connecting. The Areena servers now refuses to talk
  to us without it. Also other changes that bring the generated RTMP
  packets closer to Areena flash player.

15 Jul 2009, version 1.1

- Support for Areena net radios and live streams (although live
  streams are buggy).
- Support for Akamai servers (only live streams tested).
- Fixed compilation on Fedora 11.
- Options --quiet and --verbose for controlling the output verbosity.
  Be quieter by default.
- Use considerably less CPU by updating the progress indicator less
  frequently.
- Fixed a buffer overflow and other potential problems. Thanks to
  Reijo Tomperi.
- Use the PREFIX defined in Makefile when calling rtmpdump-yle in
  yle-dl.
- It is now possible to download videos that require YLE passi by
  giving the Areena cookie with the --auth command line option.
- Append the optional parameters to the play packet only when their
  values differ from default. The server seems be less likely to drop
  connections this way.
- yle-dl now correctly quotes parameters that contains white space.

22 Jun 2009, version 1.0.2

- Fixed a memory corruption in MP3 URL parsing code caused by
  allocating too few bytes.
- Remove '/' from the file names, and '.' from the beginning of the
  file names.
- Removed bashisms from yle-dl. Fixes --help on non-bash shells.
- Avoid the temporary file by create the final destination file after
  receiving stream title but before starting downloading.
- Don't overwrite files: append an integer to file name, if the file
  already exists.
- When extracting clip ID, download the page if necessary. Now also
  program name URLs can be used in addition to clip ID URLs.

15 Jun 2009, version 1.0.1

- Use .flv extension for the downloaded files. Some media players (vlc
  at least) seem to have problems playing them otherwise.

14 Jun 2009, version 1.0

- Initial release
